Rock Paper Paper

by Lee Spector

Early days, still.

Based on ideas from conversations with:

- Clifford Bohm
- Charles Ofria
- Joshua Newman
- Anya Spector

Some files are gorilla-repl worksheets, for which you must have leiningen. The assumption is that you will `cd` to the project directory, `lein gorilla`, and then load/execute workseets.
